📇 **Week 6 – Contact Book App & Working with APIs**

Welcome to Week 6 of the FNB App Academy and the final week of the Intermediate Phase!

Over the past two weeks, I’ve been building my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and now I’m ready for my most advanced project yet: a fully functional Contact Book app. The unique aspect of this project is that, instead of storing contact information directly in the code, the app connects to an API to fetch and manage real data from an external database.

This means I’m moving beyond static pages and stepping into the world of dynamic data and remote communication—a major milestone in web development.

### 🌐 What’s an API, and Why Does It Matter?

An **API** (Application Programming Interface) is a bridge that allows my app to communicate with other services. APIs are how modern apps:

- Get live weather information
- Pull user profiles
- Show social media feeds
- Search databases (like I’m doing with contacts)

By learning to work with APIs, I’m unlocking one of the most powerful tools in modern web development.

### 🎯 Focus for the Week

- Understand how to make requests and handle responses in JavaScript
- Learn about fetching data, working with JSON, and rendering that data into HTML
- Combine all three core skills—structure (HTML), style (CSS), and logic (JavaScript)—to build a dynamic, real-world app

### ✅ Final Thoughts

This week marks the end of the Intermediate Phase, and it’s been quite a journey. I’ve progressed from building static pages to creating interactive, data-driven applications. The Contact Book app is more than just another project—it’s proof that I can build something that communicates with the internet.

That’s a big achievement.

Let’s finish strong!
